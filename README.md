# MorningToons
Small program to help decide Sunday morning cartoons with the roommates

*******************INSTRUCTIONS*******************
| The program runs particular to a formatted CSV |
| The format of the CSV must follow the outline: |
|                              Show name, Score  |
|                              show1,     score1 |
|                              show2,     score2 |
|                              etc,       etc    |
| The first two "header" lines are removed, and  |
| each title/score combination is combined into  |
| a single data structure. To use this program,  |
| there is a sample CSV and a sample .bat file   |
| to reference.                                  |
